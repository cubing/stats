stats.cubing.net is a website that collects statistics based on the WCA results database (http://worlducbeassociation.org/results/). All statistics use php and MySQL quersie on the latest WCA results database export.

Goals
* (unofficial) updated statistics on one website
* user-submitted statistics code (php and MySQL)

Why do we need this website?
Official statistics can be found on the WCA Statistics page. Although popular statistics may be incorporated into the official WCA Statistics page, some statistics are inherently unofficial, e.g. different proposed global ranking systemts. The hope, moreover, is to encourage cubers, especially those without server access, to learn and experiment with php and MySQL.
